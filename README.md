# [Transition Center Mobile App Plugin](https://github.com/WWRFresource/WwrfMobilePlugin) #
October CMS plugin that implements RESTful API for Transition Center Website. Also includes user signins, registration, and mobile app installs. 

## Introduction ##

You can create additional RESTful controllers using this plugin, in addition to managing mobile app installs, and front-end user registrations and signins. You can add iOS, Android and other app store listings to your October backend. Individual mobile app installs can be monitored as well by adding frontend code to the application.

Parts of this plugin are similar to the RainLab.User plugin, except that it is designed to work with mobile frontend apps. It exposes RESTful API nodes that enable interaction with the backend,  allowing users to sign up and login as front-end users.

#### Features ####
* Completely extensible.
* Create RESTful API actions via scaffolding.
* Compatible with the multiple mobile app types.
* Add multiple application variants and platforms.

#### Coming Soon ####
* Add custom fields and track those values.
* Dashboard widget to provide user signup and register analytics.
* Forgot password and signing out nodes (Currently, you can do it through website only).
* Multiple Auth Schemes for better security.

### Requirements

* [Rainlab.User plugin](http://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user).

Most of the [RainLab User Documentation](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user#documentation) applies to this as well, since it's extended over that.

## Creating RESTful API ##

A scaffold command has been created to allow the creation of RESTful API controllers. The following command is available in the CLI:

```
php artisan create:apicontroller Acme.Plugin ControllerName
```

However, it does more than just that, you have the ability to override the api actions (verbs) with your own logic. The first version of the plugin is minimal and only provides default behavior for `index` verb. I will add default behavior logic for the more common verbs (create, store, show, edit, update, destroy) in the next update. Most RESTful APIs use custom logic and hide several fields so usually the behavior should be overridden than using the default behavior.

RESTful API logic can be combined with the controlled created by create:controller. All you need to do is add the RESTful API behavior to the $implement property of your controller class. Be sure to define a $restConfig property, and the value set to the YAML file for configuring the behavior.
```
namespace Acme\Blog\Controllers;

class Categories extends \Backend\Classes\Controller
{
    public $implement = ['Lmbdev.WwrfApi.Behaviors.ApiController'];

    public $restConfig = 'config_rest.yaml';
}
```

The behavior is configured using the config_rest.yaml file. Place this file in the controller's views directory. A basic example is below:
```
# ===================================
#  Rest Behavior Config
# ===================================

# Allowed Rest Actions
allowedActions:
  - store

# Model Class name
modelClass: Acme\Blog\Models\Post

# Verb Method Prefix
prefix: api
```

The prefix prevents controller actions from conflicting. Typical actions include: index, update, and preview (behaviors found in the ListController and FormController). RESTful methods should not conflict with these methods. You need to override the default controller logic by writing a method with the prefix signature, followed by the camel case verb name. For example, **public function apiStore()**.

Finally, create a routes.php file. Here’s the general template:
```
<?php

Route::group(['prefix' => 'api/v1'], function () {
    Route::resource('posts', 'Acme\Blog\Controller\Posts');
});
```
Although this method will work, it is generally recommended to use the scaffolding command.

## API Details ##

You can manually create **Android** using Platforms settings directly.

### Client-side Integration ###

Once you have created the plugin entry in the backend, you can do the client side integration. On the mobile app, you will have to make a call to the backend using the RESTful API that has been provided. This is how it works:

#### POST /installs ####

**Resource URL:** [/api/v1/installs](/api/v1/installs) [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/1f9efcfa94c93810e739)

| Parameters | Description
------------- | -------------
instance_id  | A unique ID, such as device ID or an ID generated using Google’s Instance ID API. Eg. 573b61d82b4e46e3
package  | The package name of the application. Must match the name specified in the variants. Eg. com.acme.myapp

## Mobile Front-end User Management ##

### Client-side Integration ###

**Note:** Make sure you have finished the client side integration for the mobile plugin first. Any route calls to this plugin’s nodes MUST happen AFTER the **installs** route request of the mobile plugin. Otherwise, an error may be thrown.
On the mobile app, you will have to make a call to the backend using the REST API that has been provided. Right now, the API works like this:

#### POST /account/signin ####

**Resource URL:** [/api/v1/account/signin](/api/v1/account/signin) [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/997ae8398f934757e196)

 | Parameters | Description
------------- | -------------
instance_id  | A unique ID, such as device ID or an ID generated using Google’s Instance ID API. Eg. 573b61d82b4e46e3
package  | The package name of the application. Must match the name specified in the variants. Eg. com.acme.myapp
email (or) username | The login attribute for the user attempting to sign in.
password | The password for the user attempting to sign in.

#### POST /account/register ####

**Resource URL:** [/api/v1/account/register](/api/v1/account/register) [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/997ae8398f934757e196)

 | Parameters | Description
------------- | -------------
name | The name of the user attempting registration.
email | The email for the user attempting registration.
username (optional) | The username for the user attempting registration.
password | The password for the user attempting registration.
